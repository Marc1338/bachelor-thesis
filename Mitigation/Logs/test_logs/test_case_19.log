=== LLM Analysis ===

Analysis:
The generated code has three errors:

1. The function name should be `surface_area_sphere` instead of `surfacearea_sphere`.
2. There is a missing import statement for the `math` module, which is used in the `assert` statements.
3. The `rel_tol` parameter in the `assert` statements should be defined as a constant, not as a variable.

To repair the code, here is the corrected version:

[PYTHON] CODE [/PYTHON]

def surface_area_sphere(radius):
    return 4 * math.pi * radius ** 2

import math

test_cases = [
    ("import math => Passed", None),
    ("assert math.isclose(surface_area_sphere(10), 1256.6370614359173, rel_tol=0.001)", None),
    ("assert math.isclose(surface_area_sphere(15), 2827.4333882308138, rel_tol=0.001)", None),
    ("assert math.isclose(surface_area_sphere(20), 5026.548245743669, rel_tol=0.001)", None)
]

In the above code, the function name has been corrected to `surface_area_sphere`, and the missing import statement for the `math` module has been added. Additionally, the `rel_tol` parameter in the `assert` statements has been defined as a constant (0.001) instead of a variable.

The test cases have also been updated to reflect the corrected function signature and the imported `math` module.
