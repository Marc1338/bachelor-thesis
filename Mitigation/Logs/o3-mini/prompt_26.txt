Analysis:
The generated code uses math.ceil(math.sqrt(n)) to compute the square root ceiling of n. This approach works for numbers that are not perfect squares but fails when n itself is a perfect square. For instance, when n is 9, math.sqrt(9) returns 3, and math.ceil(3) remains 3. Squaring 3 yields 9, but the requirement asks for the next perfect square greater than 9 (which is 16). 

To fix this, we need to check if n is already a perfect square. If so, we should compute the square of (sqrt(n) + 1). If not, we use math.ceil to determine the next integer and then square it.

1. The provided code uses math.ceil(math.sqrt(n)) unconditionally. This approach works when n is not a perfect square; however, it fails when n is already a perfect square because math.ceil will return the same integer. For example, for n = 9, math.sqrt(9) returns 3.0, math.ceil(3.0) returns 3, and 3 * 3 is 9, which is not greater than 9 as required.
2. To fix this, the code must check whether n is a perfect square. If it is, the function should return the square of the next integer. Otherwise, it should use math.ceil.

Analysis:
The generated code fails to address the case when the input number is already a perfect square. For example, when n equals 9, the square root is exactly 3, and math.ceil returns 3. Squaring it produces 9, which is not greater than the input. To fix this, we need to check if n is a perfect square and, if so, return the square of the next integer. If n is not a perfect square, we can safely use math.ceil as before.

--- Sample 4: PASSED ---
LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The generated code calculates the next perfect square by taking the ceiling of the square root of n and squaring it. This approach works when n is not a perfect square. However, when n is already a perfect square (like 9), taking the ceiling of its square root returns the same integer (e.g., ceil(sqrt(9)) returns 3) and thus returns n itself (3² = 9). The requirement is to return the next perfect square greater than n. To fix this, we need to check if n is a perfect square. If it is, we add 1 to the square root before squaring it. Otherwise, we can proceed with the ceiling approach.

LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The generated code does not correctly handle the case where the input number is already a perfect square. For example, when n equals 9, math.sqrt(9) returns 3 and math.ceil(3) is still 3, so the code returns 9. However, the prompt requires that the function returns the next perfect square greater than the given number, so for 9 the expected result is 16. To fix this, the function must check if the square root of n is an integer. If it is, then the root should be incremented by one before squaring.

The provided code computes the ceiling of the square root of the given number and returns its square. This works for numbers that are not perfect squares; however, when the number is already a perfect square (like 9), math.ceil(math.sqrt(n)) returns the square root itself, meaning that squaring it returns the original number (9), not the next perfect square as required. To fix this, we need to check if the given number is a perfect square. If it is, we use the next integer (i.e., add 1 to the square root) before squaring; otherwise, we can use math.ceil(math.sqrt(n)).

--- Sample 8: PASSED ---
LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The generated code incorrectly handles the case when the given number is already a perfect square. Using math.ceil(math.sqrt(n)) will return the same integer when n is a perfect square, resulting in the same number rather than the next perfect square. For example, when n equals 9, math.sqrt(9) is 3 and math.ceil(3) is also 3, so 3*3 returns 9 whereas the expected next perfect square is 16.

To correct this, we should:
• Compute the square root of n.
• Check if n is a perfect square (i.e., if the square root is an integer). If yes, then increment the square root by 1 before squaring.
• If n is not a perfect square, then use math.ceil to get the next integer.

1. The generated code calculates the next perfect square by computing the ceiling of the square root of n and returning its square. This works correctly for numbers that are not perfect squares (e.g., 35), but fails for numbers that are already perfect squares.
2. For a perfect square (e.g., n = 9), the square root is an integer (3). Using math.ceil(3) still yields 3, and squaring 3 gives 9, which is not greater than 9. According to the prompt, the function should return the next perfect square, which in this case is 16.
