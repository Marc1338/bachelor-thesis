The generated code only replaces spaces with underscores. However, the prompt requires that the function should not only convert spaces to underscores, but also convert underscores to spaces. In particular, the test case:
  assert replace_spaces('The_Avengers') == 'The Avengers'
fails because the underscore is not converted to a space. To correct this, we need to perform both conversions. A common approach is to temporarily replace one of the characters with a placeholder to avoid interfering with the second replacement. For example, we can replace "_" with a placeholder string (one that we expect not to appear in the string), then replace spaces with underscores, and finally replace the placeholder with a space.

    # Replace spaces with underscore

Analysis:
The generated code only replaces spaces with underscores. However, the prompt requires the function to perform a two-way replacement: also, any underscores in the string should be replaced with spaces. In the given test cases, "The_Avengers" should become "The Avengers", but the generated code does not handle that case.

To fix this, we can iterate through the string character by character and perform the replacement accordingly. This avoids issues with sequential replacements (for instance, if you try replacing underscores with spaces first, then replacing spaces with underscores, you might replace the ones you just inserted). A simple list comprehension that switches ' ' to '_' and '_' to ' ' is an effective solution.

LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The generated code only replaces spaces with underscores, which is half of the intended transformation. The requirement is to swap spaces and underscores. Therefore, when an underscore is found, it should be replaced with a space. In other words, the function must convert spaces to underscores and underscores to spaces. This can be achieved by using a translation table (or equivalent logic) that maps " " to "_" and "_" to " ". Additionally, note that the test case "assert replace_spaces('The_Avengers') == 'The Avengers'" fails because the reverse mapping (underscore to space) is missing.

LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The generated code only handles replacing spaces with underscores, but the prompt requires that the function also does the reverse (i.e., replacing underscores with spaces). This means any underscore in the original string should be converted to a space, and any space should be converted to an underscore. To fix this, we need to iterate over each character in the string and check:
- If it's a space (" "), replace it with an underscore ("_").
- If it's an underscore ("_"), replace it with a space (" ").
- Otherwise, keep the character unchanged.

Analysis:
The prompt requires a function that not only converts spaces to underscores but also underscores to spaces. The generated code only changes spaces into underscores by doing s.replace(' ', '_'), which is why the test case "assert replace_spaces('The_Avengers') == 'The Avengers'" fails. In order to meet the prompt requirements, the function should iterate over the string and swap each whitespace and underscore appropriately. We can achieve this by examining each character in the string and building a new result string.

--- Sample 6: PASSED ---
LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The prompt requires swapping spaces and underscores such that all spaces in the string become underscores and all underscores become spaces. However, the generated code only handled one direction (spaces to underscores) using s.replace(' ', '_'). As a result, it failed the test case for input "The_Avengers" where underscores should be converted to spaces. To fix this, we need to ensure that both spaces and underscores are replaced. One efficient way to do this is to use the translate() function with a translation table that swaps the two characters.

LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The generated code only replaces spaces with underscores. The prompt requires a function that replaces every whitespace with an underscore, and vice versa (i.e., each underscore should be replaced with a space). Therefore, the code must perform a two-way replacement. A common mistake is that when you try to replace spaces and underscores sequentially, the first replacement might interfere with the second. To avoid this, a temporary placeholder (that is not expected to be in the input) should be used for one of the transformations. For example, replace spaces with a placeholder, then replace underscores with spaces, and finally replace the placeholder with underscores.

--- Sample 9: PASSED ---
LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The prompt requires us to replace whitespaces with underscores and underscores with whitespaces. The generated code only replaces spaces with underscores and does not handle underscores. For example, the test case assert replace_spaces('The_Avengers') == 'The Avengers' fails.

To fix this, we must ensure that the function replaces underscores with spaces as well. One way to achieve this safely is to use an intermediate placeholder. For instance, we can first replace all underscores with a temporary token, then replace spaces with underscores, and finally replace the temporary token with spaces. Alternatively, a character-wise replacement using a list comprehension would work as well.

LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The generated code only replaces spaces with underscores, which satisfies only half of the requirement. According to the prompt, the function should also replace underscores with spaces. In other words, the function must perform a bidirectional replacement:
- Replace all whitespace characters (spaces) with underscores.
- Replace all underscores with spaces.

Using two successive replacements (e.g., using s.replace() twice) might lead to incorrect results because the first replacement might affect characters that are then altered by the second replacement. The correct approach is to swap the characters simultaneously. This can be achieved by using a translation table with str.maketrans(), or by iterating through each character and swapping accordingly.
