1. The prompt requires calculating the sum of the Perrin numbers. The Perrin sequence is defined by:
  • P(0) = 3, P(1) = 0, P(2) = 2
  • For n ≥ 3, P(n) = P(n-2) + P(n-3)
  For example, the series begins as: 3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 7, 10, 12, …
  The test cases (e.g., cal_sum(9) == 49) indicate that the function should sum P(0) through P(9).

2. The generated code incorrectly uses the Fibonacci recurrence. It initializes a = 0 and b = 1 and computes the Fibonacci sequence, not the Perrin sequence. This results in the wrong outputs.

3. To repair the code:
  • Initialize the first three Perrin numbers: [3, 0, 2].
  • For indices from 3 up to n, compute P(i) = P(i-2) + P(i-3).
  • Sum all computed values from index 0 to n.

1. The generated code initializes values as a = 0 and b = 1 and then uses Fibonacci recurrence (a, b = b, a + b). However, the prompt asks for the sum of Perrin numbers. The Perrin sequence is defined with different initial values and recurrence. Specifically, the Perrin sequence is defined as:
  P(0) = 3, P(1) = 0, P(2) = 2
  For n ≥ 3, P(n) = P(n−2) + P(n−3)
2. The code must generate the Perrin sequence from index 0 up to n (inclusive) and then return the sum of those n+1 numbers.
3. For example, when n = 9, the Perrin sequence is:
  P(0)=3, P(1)=0, P(2)=2, P(3)=3, P(4)=2, P(5)=5, P(6)=5, P(7)=7, P(8)=10, P(9)=12.
  Their sum is 3+0+2+3+2+5+5+7+10+12 = 49.
4. The corrections include starting with the proper initial values and using the correct recurrence to generate the sequence.

--- Sample 3: PASSED ---
LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The generated code mistakenly uses the Fibonacci recurrence (a = 0, b = 1, a + b) whereas the prompt requires calculating Perrin numbers. The Perrin sequence is defined differently. One common definition is:
  P(0) = 3,
  P(1) = 0,
  P(2) = 2,
and for n ≥ 3,
  P(n) = P(n − 2) + P(n − 3).

Furthermore, the test cases are based on summing the first (n+1) Perrin numbers. For example, cal_sum(9) should sum P(0) through P(9):
  [3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 7, 10, 12] → Sum = 49.
Thus, the correct approach is to generate the Perrin numbers with the correct initial values and recurrence, summing from index 0 up to n (which actually gives n+1 terms).

The repair involves:
• Setting the initial values to 3, 0, and 2.
• Iterating from index 3 to n and computing the next Perrin number as perrin[i] = perrin[i-2] + perrin[i-3].
• Accumulating the sum.

--- Sample 4: PASSED ---
LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The generated code is computing the Fibonacci series instead of the Perrin numbers. In the Perrin sequence, the recurrence is defined as:
  P(n) = P(n–2) + P(n–3)
with initial values:
  P(0) = 3, P(1) = 0, P(2) = 2.
The expected behavior is to return the sum of the Perrin numbers from index 0 to n. For example, when n = 9 the Perrin numbers are:
  P(0)=3, P(1)=0, P(2)=2, P(3)=3, P(4)=2, P(5)=5, P(6)=5, P(7)=7, P(8)=10, P(9)=12
and their sum is 3+0+2+3+2+5+5+7+10+12 = 49.

The generated code uses initial values and a recurrence for the Fibonacci sequence (starting with 0 and 1) instead of following the Perrin sequence rules. To repair the code, we need to:
1. Initialize with the correct starting Perrin numbers.
2. Update the recurrence to use P(n) = P(n–2) + P(n–3).
3. Sum all terms from P(0) to P(n).

LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
1. The generated code uses the Fibonacci recurrence (a, b = b, a+b) with starting values (0, 1) which is incorrect. For Perrin numbers the recurrence is P(n) = P(n-2) + P(n-3) with specific initial values.
2. The Perrin sequence must start with P(0)=3, P(1)=0, and P(2)=2. Then for n ≥ 3, P(n)=P(n-2)+P(n-3).
3. The prompt requires summing the Perrin numbers from index 0 to n (inclusive). In the test case, cal_sum(9) should equal 49 because P(0)+P(1)+…+P(9)= 3+0+2+3+2+5+5+7+10+12 = 49.
4. The loop in the generated code iterates n times (summing Fibonacci numbers) rather than building the Perrin sequence with the correct recurrence and initial values.

To fix these issues:
• Use the correct initial values: p0=3, p1=0, p2=2.
• For indices 3 through n use the recurrence next = p_minus3 + p_minus2.
• Sum the numbers as you generate them, remembering that if n is the index of the last term then we need to add all terms P(0) through P(n).

Analysis:
The original code uses the Fibonacci recurrence with initial values a = 0 and b = 1, which is incorrect for the Perrin sequence. In the Perrin sequence, the initial conditions are:
  P(0) = 3, P(1) = 0, P(2) = 2,
and for n ≥ 3, the recurrence is:
  P(n) = P(n−2) + P(n−3).

In addition, the prompt expects the function to sum all Perrin numbers from index 0 up to n (inclusive). For instance, when n = 9 the sequence is:
  3, 0, 2, 3, 2, 5, 5, 7, 10, 12
and their sum is 49 (as required by the test case). The generated code calculates the Fibonacci sum for n iterations and does not follow the Perrin recurrence.

To repair the code, we need to:
1. Initialize a list with the base Perrin numbers [3, 0, 2].
2. Iterate from index 3 to n (inclusive) to compute subsequent terms using P(n) = P(n−2) + P(n−3).
3. Return the sum of the sequence from index 0 to n.

3. The expected behavior (e.g., cal_sum(9) returning 49) implies that cal_sum(n) should sum the perrin numbers from index 0 to n. Verifying manually:
  P(0)=3, P(1)=0, P(2)=2, P(3)=3 (0+3), P(4)=2 (2+0), P(5)=5 (3+2), P(6)=5 (2+3), P(7)=7 (5+2), P(8)=10 (5+5), P(9)=12 (7+5). The sum from index 0 to 9 is 3+0+2+3+2+5+5+7+10+12 = 49.

1. The generated code is computing a Fibonacci-like sum rather than the Perrin sequence. The Perrin sequence is defined by:
   • P(0) = 3
   • P(1) = 0
   • P(2) = 2
   • For n ≥ 3, P(n) = P(n‐2) + P(n‐3)
2. The prompt asks for the sum of the Perrin numbers from index 0 up to a given n (inclusive). For example, cal_sum(9) should sum P(0) to P(9). With the Perrin sequence defined above, we have:
   • P(0)=3, P(1)=0, P(2)=2, P(3)=P(1)+P(0)=3, P(4)=P(2)+P(1)=2, P(5)=P(3)+P(2)=5, P(6)=P(4)+P(3)=5, P(7)=P(5)+P(4)=7, P(8)=P(6)+P(5)=10, P(9)=P(7)+P(6)=12
   • Their sum: 3 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 10 + 12 = 49
3. Instead of computing Fibonacci numbers, the code needs to:
   • Initialize with the proper base values for the Perrin sequence.
   • Use the recurrence P(n)=P(n-2)+P(n-3) for n ≥ 3.
   • Sum the computed numbers from P(0) to P(n).

--- Sample 10: PASSED ---

Analysis:
The generated code is actually computing a Fibonacci‐like sum. In contrast, the prompt asks for the “sum of perrin numbers.” The Perrin numbers are defined by a different recurrence. In the standard definition the Perrin sequence is given by:

  P(0) = 3  
  P(1) = 0  
  P(2) = 2  
  For n ≥ 3: P(n) = P(n – 2) + P(n – 3)

Then, based on the test asserts, the function should return the sum of Perrin numbers from index 0 up to n (inclusive). For example, when n = 9 the sequence is computed as:  
  P(0)=3, P(1)=0, P(2)=2, P(3)=P(1)+P(0)=3, P(4)=P(2)+P(1)=2, P(5)=P(3)+P(2)=5,  
  P(6)=P(4)+P(3)=5, P(7)=P(5)+P(4)=7, P(8)=P(6)+P(5)=10, P(9)=P(7)+P(6)=12  
so that the sum from P(0) through P(9) is  
  3 + 0 + 2 + 3 + 2 + 5 + 5 + 7 + 10 + 12 = 49  
which matches the first assert.

The errors in the generated code include:
1. Using variables a and b with initial values 0 and 1 (Fibonacci initial conditions) instead of using the Perrin initial values (3, 0, 2).
2. Using the recurrence a, b = b, a + b which is the Fibonacci recurrence rather than the Perrin recurrence.
3. Iterating n times without taking into account that the Perrin sequence should start with indices 0, 1, and 2 set as above and then generate terms for indices 3 through n.

To repair the code, we initialize a list with [3, 0, 2] and then for i from 3 to n (inclusive) compute P(i) = P(i–2) + P(i–3). Finally, we return the sum of all values from index 0 to n.

    # For small n, handle directly.
