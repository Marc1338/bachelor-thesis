--- Sample 1: PASSED ---
LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The error in the generated code is that the function's name does not match the one specified in the prompt. The prompt expects a function called lateralsurface_cube, but the generated code defines a function named lateral_surface_cube. This discrepancy causes the "name not defined" errors when test cases attempt to call lateralsurface_cube. To fix the code, simply rename the function to lateralsurface_cube.

--- Sample 2: PASSED ---
LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The error in the generated code is due to the function name mismatch. The prompt instructs the function to be named lateralsurface_cube (without an underscore between "lateral" and "surface"), but the provided code defines the function as lateral_surface_cube. As a result, when the test cases try to call lateralsurface_cube, Python raises a "name not defined" error. To correct this, we simply need to rename the function to lateralsurface_cube.

--- Sample 3: PASSED ---
LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The generated code defines the function with the name "lateral_surface_cube", whereas the prompt and test cases expect a function named "lateralsurface_cube" (without the underscore between lateral and surface). This naming inconsistency causes the error "name 'lateralsurface_cube' is not defined" when attempting to run the test cases. To correct the issue, the function name must be changed to match exactly what is expected by the test cases.

--- Sample 5: PASSED ---
LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
1. The function name in the prompt’s test case is lateralsurface_cube (without underscores between “lateral” and “surface”), while the generated code uses lateral_surface_cube. This results in a NameError when the test cases call lateralsurface_cube.
2. The formula used to compute the lateral surface area (4 * side_length^2) is correct, so no changes are needed there.

--- Sample 6: PASSED ---
LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The generated code computes the lateral surface area correctly (4 * side_length²). However, the function’s name does not match the expected name from the prompt. The prompt uses lateralsurface_cube (without an underscore) in the test case, while the code defines the function as lateral_surface_cube (with an underscore). Renaming the function to lateralsurface_cube will resolve the name error seen in the test results.

--- Sample 7: PASSED ---
LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The error in the generated code is that the function name defined is "lateral_surface_cube" while the test cases call "lateralsurface_cube". This mismatch in function names results in a NameError since the function being invoked is not defined. The correction is to change the function name to "lateralsurface_cube" so it matches the test case calls.

--- Sample 8: PASSED ---
LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The generated code defined the function as lateral_surface_cube instead of lateralsurface_cube (without the underscore) as expected by the test cases. This results in a NameError when attempting to call lateralsurface_cube. Other than the naming issue, the calculation (4 * (side_length ** 2)) correctly computes the lateral surface area of a cube.

Analysis:
The generated code defines the function as lateral_surface_cube, while the prompt and test assertions expect a function named lateralsurface_cube (without the underscore between "lateral" and "surface").

--- Sample 10: PASSED ---

Analysis:
The error stems from a naming mismatch. The prompt and test cases refer to a function named lateralsurface_cube, but the generated code defines the function as lateral_surface_cube (with an underscore between "lateral" and "surface"). As a result, when running the test cases, Python cannot find a function with the name lateralsurface_cube. To fix this, we should rename the function to lateralsurface_cube to match the prompt.
