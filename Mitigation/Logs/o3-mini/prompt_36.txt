Analysis:
1. The core error in the generated code is the incorrect formula for computing the nth decagonal number. The provided formula, n * (5 * n - 4), computes 5n² - 4n. However, the correct formula for the nth decagonal number is 4n² - 3n.
2. The test cases indicate that when using the current formula, the outputs are consistently higher than the expected values. For example, for n = 3, the generated code produces 33, whereas the expected decagonal number is 27.
3. To resolve this, update the multiplication expression from n * (5 * n - 4) to 4 * n**2 - 3 * n.

LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
1. The formula used in the generated code is incorrect. The code computes the decagonal number using n * (5 * n - 4), but the correct formula for the nth decagonal number is n * (4 * n - 3). For example, when n = 3, the correct computation is 3 * (4 * 3 - 3) = 3 * 9 = 27.
2. Once the formula is fixed, the test cases will produce the expected results.

--- Sample 3: PASSED ---
LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The generated code uses the formula n * (5*n - 4) to calculate the decagonal number, but this is incorrect. The decagonal number should be calculated using the formula n * (4*n - 3). For example, for n = 3, the correct calculation is 3 * (4*3 - 3) = 3 * 9 = 27. The current code returns 33 for n = 3, which does not match the expected result. The errors should be fixed by updating the formula in the function.

--- Sample 4: PASSED ---
LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The error in the generated code lies in the formula used to compute the decagonal number. The formula used by the generated code is:
  n * (5 * n - 4)  →  5n² - 4n
However, the correct formula for the nth decagonal number is:
  4n² - 3n
This formula satisfies the given test cases (for instance, for n = 3: 4×9 - 3×3 = 27, which is the expected value).

--- Sample 5: PASSED ---
LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The error in the generated code lies in the formula used to compute the nth decagonal number. According to the prompt and the provided test case (assert is_num_decagonal(3) == 27), the correct formula to compute the nth decagonal number is:
  decagonal(n) = 4*n² - 3*n

However, the generated code incorrectly uses:
  n * (5*n - 4) → = 5*n² - 4*n,
which produces incorrect results (e.g., is_num_decagonal(3) yields 33 instead of 27).

To fix the issue, we must update the formula within the function to correctly compute 4*n² - 3*n.

--- Sample 6: PASSED ---
LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The generated code incorrectly calculates the decagonal number using the formula n * (5*n - 4). The correct formula for the nth decagonal number is 4*n**2 - 3*n. For example, for n=3 the correct decagonal number is 4*3² - 3*3 = 36 - 9 = 27. The errors in the generated code stem from using the wrong formula.

--- Sample 7: PASSED ---
LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
1. The generated code uses an incorrect formula. For decagonal numbers, the nth decagonal number is given by: 4n² - 3n, not n*(5n - 4). Verifying with the prompt sample:
   - For n = 3, the correct value is 4*9 - 3*3 = 36 - 9 = 27.
2. The function name "is_num_decagonal" is used in the prompt, so we keep that naming even though the prefix "is_" might create confusion as it usually indicates a boolean function.

--- Sample 8: PASSED ---
LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The generated code uses an incorrect formula for the nth decagonal number. The correct formula (as implied by the test case) is:
  nth_decagonal = n * (4 * n - 3)
For example, when n = 3, the formula gives:
  3 * (4 * 3 - 3) = 3 * (12 - 3) = 3 * 9 = 27,
which matches the expected output. The generated code mistakenly uses:
  n * (5 * n - 4)
which produces 33 for n = 3. To fix the problem, the formula should be updated accordingly.

--- Sample 9: PASSED ---
LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The generated code incorrectly calculates the nth decagonal number by using the formula n * (5 * n - 4) instead of the correct formula. Based on the prompt and test cases (e.g., is_num_decagonal(3) should return 27), the correct formula for the nth decagonal number is:
  n * (4 * n - 3)
For instance, when n = 3, the value is 3 * (4 * 3 - 3) = 3 * 9 = 27. This correction ensures that subsequent test cases will also output the expected results.

--- Sample 10: PASSED ---
LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The intended function should compute the nth decagonal number with the formula d(n) = 4*n^2 - 3*n. However, the generated code uses the incorrect formula n*(5*n - 4), which expands to 5*n^2 - 4*n and yields wrong results (e.g., for n=3 it produces 33 instead of 27). To correct the code, we need to use the proper formula.
