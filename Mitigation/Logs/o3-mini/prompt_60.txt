1. The generated code computes the absolute difference between the full numbers (i.e. abs(num1 - num2)) instead of computing the absolute differences for each corresponding digit.
2. According to the prompt and test cases, the function should convert the numbers to strings, iterate over the digits pairwise, compute the absolute difference of each pair, and sum these differences. For example, digit_distance_nums(23,56) should compute abs(2-5) + abs(3-6), resulting in 3+3 = 6.
3. The test results indicate that for input 23 and 56, the function returns 33 instead of 6. Similarly, for 123 and 256, it returns 133 instead of 7. This confirms that the current approach is incorrect.

To fix the function:
- Convert both numbers to strings.
- Use zip to pair corresponding digits.
- Convert each digit back to an integer, compute the absolute difference, and sum these differences.
- Return the computed sum.

The generated code simply computes the absolute difference between the two numbers (abs(num1 - num2)), which fails to meet the requirement. The task is to compute the sum of the per-digit differences. For example, with inputs 23 and 56, we should compare 2 with 5 (difference 3) and 3 with 6 (difference 3) to return 6 in total.

To fix the error:
1. Convert the numbers to strings.
2. Pad the shorter string with leading zeros if necessary (to handle numbers with different lengths).
3. Iterate over corresponding digits, compute the absolute difference for each pair, and accumulate the sum.
4. Return the computed sum.

The original generated code simply returns the absolute difference between the two numbers (abs(num1 - num2)), which does not meet the requirement. The prompt asks for the sum of the per-digit differences between the corresponding digits of the two numbers. To correctly implement this, we need to convert the numbers to strings, ensure they have the same length by padding with zeros if necessary, and then calculate the absolute difference between each pair of corresponding digits, summing those differences.

--- Sample 4: PASSED ---
LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The prompt requires the function to compute "the sum of the per-digit difference" between two integers. This means that the function should compare each corresponding digit of the two numbers and add up the absolute differences of these digit pairs. The generated code incorrectly computes the overall difference (abs(num1-num2)) rather than performing a digit-by-digit comparison.

Additionally, the function must handle numbers with different numbers of digits. A common approach is to convert the numbers to strings, pad the shorter string with zeros on the left (using zfill) to match the lengths, and then compute the differences for each digit.

LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The generated code mistakenly calculates the absolute difference between the two numbers as a whole (using abs(num1 - num2)), rather than calculating the sum of the per-digit differences. For example, for the input (23, 56), it returns abs(23 - 56) = 33 instead of calculating |2-5| + |3-6| = 3 + 3 = 6.

To fix this, we need to:
1. Convert both numbers to strings so that we can iterate over their individual digits.
2. If the numbers have different numbers of digits, pad the shorter string with zeros on the left.
3. Iterate over corresponding digits, calculate the absolute difference for each pair, and accumulate the sum.

--- Sample 6: PASSED ---
LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The generated code simply returns the absolute difference between the two numbers, i.e. abs(num1 - num2). This does not meet the prompt’s requirement of "the sum of the per-digit difference between two integers." For example, when comparing 123 and 256, the code calculates abs(123-256)=133 instead of calculating the digit differences: |1-2| + |2-5| + |3-6| = 1 + 3 + 3 = 7.

To repair this, we need to compute the difference for each corresponding digit beginning from the rightmost digit. A simple approach is to repeatedly extract the last digit (using modulo 10) from each number, compute their absolute difference, add it to a running total, and then remove the last digit by integer division by 10. This loop should continue until both numbers have been fully processed.

        digit2 = num2 % 10 if num2 > 0 else 0

However, the generated code computes the absolute difference of the entire numbers (i.e. abs(num1 - num2)), which is incorrect. Additionally, the generated code does not handle the case where the two numbers may have a different number of digits. To correct this, we need to:
1. Convert both numbers into strings.
2. Pad the shorter string with zeros (using zfill) so that they have the same length.

The prompt asks for the sum of the per-digit differences between the two integers. For example, for digit_distance_nums(23,56), the correct calculation should be:
• Compare digits: |2 - 5| = 3 and |3 - 6| = 3, 
• Sum = 3 + 3 = 6.
The generated code erroneously calculated abs(23 - 56) = 33 instead of calculating the differences for each digit. 

To fix the code, we should:

3. To correct this error, we should convert the integers to strings (or handle them as sequences of digits), iterate over their digits pairwise (using zip), calculate the absolute difference for each pair, and then sum the results.
4. In the case the numbers have different numbers of digits, you might need to pad the smaller number with zeros. However, from the test cases provided it appears both numbers have the same number of digits, so a simple zip solution works fine.

The generated code simply returns the absolute difference between the two integers (abs(num1 - num2)). However, the intended functionality is to compute the sum of the per-digit differences. For example, with inputs 23 and 56, the correct process is to subtract each corresponding digit and sum the absolute differences: |2-5| + |3-6| = 3+3 = 6. The current code would return abs(23-56) = 33, which does not match the expected result.

To address this, the function should:
1. Convert the numbers to strings.
2. Pad the shorter string with zeros on the left if the integers have different lengths.
3. Iterate over the pairs of corresponding characters, convert each character to an integer, compute the absolute difference, and then sum these differences.
