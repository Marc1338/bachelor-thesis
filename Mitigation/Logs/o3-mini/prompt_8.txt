Analysis:
The generated code incorrectly uses a conditional expression based on whether n is even or odd. Instead of applying a simple mathematical formula, the code applies two different formulas:
• For even n: n * (6n - 3) // 4 + 1
• For odd n: n * (3n - 2) // 2

These formulas do not match the known, correct formula for centered hexagonal numbers. The standard formula is: centered_hexagonal_number(n) = 3 * n * (n - 1) + 1. This formula will produce:
 • centered_hexagonal_number(10) = 3 * 10 * 9 + 1 = 271
 • centered_hexagonal_number(2) = 3 * 2 * 1 + 1 = 7
 • centered_hexagonal_number(9) = 3 * 9 * 8 + 1 = 217

Thus the errors include:
1. Using two different formulas for even and odd values instead of one universal formula.
2. The formulas themselves do not compute the centered hexagonal numbers correctly.

--- Sample 2: PASSED ---
LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The generated code attempts to use different formulas depending on whether n is even or odd. However, the correct formula for the nth centered hexagonal number is H(n) = 3*n*(n-1) + 1. For example, for n = 10, H(10) = 3*10*9 + 1 = 271, which matches the prompt requirement. The use of conditional logic and alternative formulas in the generated code is unnecessary and introduces errors. The corrected code simply uses the formula H(n) = 3*n*(n-1) + 1.

--- Sample 3: PASSED ---
LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The generated code incorrectly distinguishes between even and odd values of n and uses two different formulas that do not match the known formula for a centered hexagonal number. The nth centered hexagonal number is given by the formula H(n) = 3 * n * (n - 1) + 1. For example, for n = 10:
  H(10) = 3 * 10 * 9 + 1 = 270 + 1 = 271.
The generated code not only complicates the logic with an unnecessary if-else condition but also applies incorrect formulas. The fix is to directly use the formula H(n) = 3 * n * (n - 1) + 1 in the function.

--- Sample 4: PASSED ---
LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The generated code used an unnecessary conditional expression that distinguishes between even and odd values of n, and applies two different formulas. In reality, the centered hexagonal numbers have a simple formula: 3*n*(n-1) + 1. This formula works for all positive integers n. For example, centered_hexagonal_number(10) should compute as 3*10*9 + 1 = 270 + 1 = 271, which is the expected result. Thus, the conditional logic and the different formulas are both incorrect and unnecessary.

LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The centered hexagonal numbers have a simple closed-form formula: centered_hexagonal_number(n) = 3 * n * (n - 1) + 1. The generated code incorrectly introduces a parity-based condition (using different formulas for even and odd n) and applies incorrect formulas that do not match the known formula for centered hexagonal numbers. This results in wrong outputs for the provided test cases.

- The generated code uses two different formulas based on whether n is even or odd. However, the correct formula for the nth centered hexagonal number is straightforward: 3*n*(n - 1) + 1.
- For example, for n = 10, the correct result is computed as 3 * 10 * 9 + 1 = 271, which matches the expected output.
- The use of conditional logic in the generated code is unnecessary and incorrect since the same formula applies regardless of parity.
- The incorrect formulas in both branches of the conditional logic lead to the wrong results.

--- Sample 8: PASSED ---
LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The mathematical formula for the nth centered hexagonal number is CH(n) = 3*n*(n-1) + 1. For example, when n = 10 the result is 3×10×9 + 1 = 271; when n = 2 the result is 3×2×1 + 1 = 7; and when n = 9 it is 3×9×8 + 1 = 217. The generated code uses a flawed conditional approach that depends on whether n is even or odd. This implementation does not reflect the intended formula, leading to incorrect results. To correct the code, we simply need to implement the mathematical formula described above.

The provided code uses two different formulas based on whether n is even or odd, which is incorrect. The nth centered hexagonal number is given by the mathematical formula:
  CenteredHexagonal(n) = 3 * n * (n - 1) + 1
This formula works for all positive integers n. The generated code instead incorrectly implements a conditional (based on n % 2) which leads to wrong outputs for provided test cases. To correct the code, the function should simply calculate and return 3 * n * (n - 1) + 1.

LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
1. The provided code uses two different formulas based on whether n is even or odd. The correct formula for the nth centered hexagonal number is H(n) = 3 * n * (n - 1) + 1, valid for all n.
2. The incorrect formulas used in the conditional branches result in wrong outputs (e.g., centered_hexagonal_number(10) returns 143 instead of 271).
3. The conditional check (n % 2 == 0) and separate branch for odd values should be removed. The function should always compute 3 * n * (n - 1) + 1.
