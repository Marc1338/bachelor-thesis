The provided code uses an incorrect formula. The prompt’s tests indicate that a 12‑year‑old human should correspond to 61 dog years, which can be achieved by using the formula where the first two years count as 10.5 dog years each (totaling 21) and every additional human year counts as 4 dog years. The generated code instead uses:
• For human_years ≤ 2: human_years * 5 + 1 (e.g., for 2 years, 2*5+1=11 dog years instead of 21).
• For human_years > 2: (human_years - 2) * 4 + 14 (e.g., for 12 years, (12-2)*4+14=54).
To correct the code, we need to:
1. Handle the case where human_years is less than or equal to 2 by returning human_years * 10.5.
2. For human_years greater than 2, return 21 (which is 2 * 10.5) plus 4 for every year above 2.
This matches the provided test case conditions.

LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The generated function uses incorrect constants for the conversion. The prompt indicates that for a human age of 12, the expected dog's age should be 61. This implies that for dogs older than 2 years, the first two years should count as 21 dog years (i.e. 10.5 dog years per human year for the first 2 years), and for every year beyond 2, add 4 dog years. However, the generated code:
• Uses human_years * 5 + 1 when human_years is less than or equal to 2, which is incorrect.
• Uses (human_years - 2) * 4 + 14 in the else branch, meaning that for 2 years it returns 14, but it should return 21.
Thus, the correct implementation should be:
• For human_years <= 2: return human_years * 10.5
• Otherwise: return 21 + (human_years - 2) * 4

--- Sample 3: PASSED ---
LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The generated code uses the formula “human_years * 5 + 1” for the first two years and then “(human_years - 2) * 4 + 14” for later years. For example, with human_years = 12 the code computes 
  (12-2)*4 + 14 = 40+14 = 54,
which does not agree with the expected 61.

If you “reverse‐engineer” the expected result for 12 years, you can see that a conversion consistent with the test cases is:
  • For the first two human years, a dog ages at 10.5 dog years per human year (so 2 years yield 2×10.5 = 21 dog years), and 
  • For every human year beyond the first two, add 4 dog years.
Thus the formula becomes:
  if human_years <= 2, then dog_years = human_years * 10.5,
  else dog_years = 21 + (human_years - 2) * 4.
For example:
  dog_age(12) = 21 + (12-2)*4 = 21 + 40 = 61,
  dog_age(15) = 21 + (15-2)*4 = 21 + 52 = 73,
  dog_age(24) = 21 + (24-2)*4 = 21 + 88 = 109.

Thus the correction is to use 10.5 for the first two human years (yielding 21 for 2 years) and then add 4 for every additional year, instead of the incorrect factors used in the generated code.

LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The generated code erroneously calculates the dog's age for the first two human years using a multiplier of 5 with an added constant (or a constant of 1 if human_years are 2 or less), which is incorrect. The provided test case indicates that for 12 human years the computed dog's age should be 61. This is achieved by the following logic:
• The first 2 human years count as 10.5 dog years each (totaling 21 dog years).
• Each subsequent human year counts as 4 dog years.
For example, for human_years = 12:
   21 (for the first 2 years) + (12 - 2) * 4 = 21 + 40 = 61.
Thus, the correct implementation should return:
   - human_years * 10.5 if human_years is less than or equal to 2, and 
   - 21 + (human_years - 2) * 4 otherwise.

LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The generated code uses the wrong conversion factors. According to the test cases, the expected conversion is as follows:
• For human years up to 2, the dog's years should be calculated as 10.5 times the human years (so for 2 years: 2 * 10.5 = 21).
• For human years beyond 2, the function should start with a base of 21 dog years for the first two human years and add 4 dog years for every additional human year.
For example, for 12 human years the calculation should be 21 + (12 - 2) * 4 = 21 + 40 = 61, which matches the provided assertion.

The generated code instead uses:
 - For human_years less than or equal to 2: human_years * 5 + 1 (e.g., for 2 years: 2*5+1 = 11, which is incorrect).
 - For human_years greater than 2: (human_years - 2) * 4 + 14 (e.g., for 12 years: 10*4+14 = 54, which is incorrect).

To repair the code, we need to apply the correct conversion factors.

Analysis:
The provided code uses the formula:
 if human_years <= 2: dog_year = human_years * 5 + 1
 else: dog_year = (human_years - 2) * 4 + 14
This formula is incorrect according to the prompt and test results. The common convention for calculating dog years is as follows:
 • For the first two human years, each human year is equivalent to 10.5 dog years.
 • For every human year after the first two, each human year is equivalent to 4 dog years.
For example:
 dog_age(12) should be calculated as (2 * 10.5) + ((12 - 2) * 4) = 21 + 40 = 61.
The generated code used multipliers of 5 and 4, and it incorrectly added 1 or 14 as offsets.

To correct the code, we need to:
1. Use 10.5 as the multiplier for human years when human_years is less than or equal to 2.
2. Use 21 (which is 2 * 10.5) for the first two years and then add (human_years - 2) * 4 for any additional years.

--- Sample 7: PASSED ---
LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The prompt specifies converting human years to “dog’s years” so that, for example, 12 human years equals 61 dog years. The common conversion rule is to use 10.5 dog years for each of the first two human years and then 4 dog years for every year thereafter. In other words, the formula is:
  • If human_years ≤ 2, then dog’s age = human_years * 10.5  
  • Otherwise, dog’s age = 21 + (human_years – 2) * 4

In the generated code, the errors are:
1. For human_years ≤ 2, it uses “human_years * 5 + 1” instead of multiplying by 10.5.
2. For human_years > 2, it uses “(human_years - 2) * 4 + 14” which underestimates the initial dog years since 2 years should count as 2 * 10.5 = 21, not 14.

These mistakes cause the computed values to be 7 less than expected for the test cases.

--- Sample 8: PASSED ---
LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
1. The generated code uses an incorrect conversion formula. The prompt’s test case dog_age(12)==61 implies that for a 12‐year human age, the resulting dog age must be 61.
2. The code uses a piecewise formula with a threshold at 2 years. In the “else” branch (human_years > 2) it computes the dog age as (human_years - 2)*4 + 14. For human_years == 12 that calculates to 10*4 + 14 = 54; however, the expected result is 61.
3. The idea is to have a continuous conversion such that the dog age for the first 2 human years is the “base” from which additional years add 4 dog years each. To satisfy the tests:
   • For human_years > 2, the dog age should be (human_years - 2)*4 + base.
   • Knowing that dog_age(12)==61, we have (12 - 2)*4 + base = 61 => 40 + base = 61, so base must be 21.
4. For completeness, the conversion for human_years <= 2 should be linear such that dog_age(2) equals 21. Therefore, if human_years <= 2, the function can return (21/2)*human_years.
5. In summary, the correct formula becomes:
   - if human_years <= 2: return (21/2) * human_years
   - else: return (human_years - 2) * 4 + 21

Analysis:
The generated code uses two branches:
 • For human_years ≤ 2 it returns human_years * 5 + 1.
 • For human_years > 2 it returns (human_years - 2) * 4 + 14.

However, testing shows that for inputs greater than 2 (e.g. 12, 15, 24) the function’s results are 7 too low compared to what is expected (i.e. dog_age(12) should be 61 but the code returns 54). In other words, both branches are missing an offset of 7.

To fix the function, we can simply add 7 to the results of both branches. That is, for the case human_years ≤ 2 change the return to human_years * 5 + 1 + 7 (which simplifies to human_years * 5 + 8) and for the case human_years > 2 change it to (human_years - 2) * 4 + 14 + 7 (which simplifies to (human_years - 2) * 4 + 21).

LLM Analysis:
Analysis:
The conversion factors in the generated code are incorrect. The typical “dog years” calculation (as implied by the expected test case values) seems to be as follows:
• For the first two human years, a dog ages enough to equal 21 dog years.
• For every human year beyond two, each year is equivalent to an additional 4 dog years.
In the generated code:
1. For human_years ≤ 2, it uses “human_years * 5 + 1” which gives 11 for 2 human years (2×5+1 = 11) instead of the required 21.
2. For human_years > 2, it adds (human_years - 2) * 4 to a base value of 14 (instead of 21). For example, dog_age(12) computes as 14 + (12-2)*4 = 54 rather than the desired 61.
To correct the code:
• For human_years ≤ 2, return (21/2)*human_years so that at 2 years it equals 21.
• For human_years > 2, return 21 + (human_years - 2)*4.
